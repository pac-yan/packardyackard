[00:44:27] [Server thread/INFO]: tedzack joined the game
[00:44:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> hi
[00:44:38] [Server thread/INFO]: [tedzack: Teleported tedzack to Optix570]
[00:44:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> hai
[00:45:32] [Server thread/INFO]: [tedzack: Set the time to 1000]
[00:45:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> do you think andrew and i love each other equally
[00:46:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yes
[00:46:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but i think you show it differently
[00:46:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> are you just saying that or is it ilke you also thonk so
[00:46:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i actually think so
[00:46:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> hmmm
[00:46:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i was talking to him earlier
[00:46:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> about not wanting to be sad
[00:46:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and one of my reasons i said that i wish i wasn't sad was because
[00:46:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> people would distance themselves from me if i were
[00:46:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and he said smt like
[00:47:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> how people who care wouldn't do that
[00:47:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and
[00:47:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that they'd prob feel worse if i hid myself from them
[00:47:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i think hes right
[00:47:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> which reminded me of people who said my sadness stressed them out or i was too sad and depressing to be around
[00:47:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> im sorry
[00:47:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i think he is nice
[00:48:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but tbh those ppl probably didnt really care in the first plac
[00:48:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> place
[00:48:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> rip
[00:48:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> max!
[00:48:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yeah
[00:48:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i
[00:48:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> was walkign through wsp
[00:48:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> the other day
[00:48:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and i did a double take
[00:48:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> bc i thought some guy in the park was max
[00:48:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and
[00:48:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> it was like
[00:48:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> going back 2 years
[00:49:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> :c
[00:49:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> like immediately felt anxious
[00:49:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> like instant anxiety
[00:49:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> thats awful
[00:49:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> stomach flipped
[00:49:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and i haven't even thought of him that much
[00:49:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i had a dream last week and he was in it
[00:49:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> its been a while
[00:50:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i think youre healing
[00:50:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yeah ig
[00:50:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> takes time
[00:50:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> lots of it
[00:50:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yeah
[00:50:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> like we started dating
[00:50:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> 2017?
[00:50:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> or no
[00:50:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> 2016
[00:50:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[00:50:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> we started dating three years ago
[00:51:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wow
[00:51:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> its been a while
[00:51:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and we stopped dating around 2 years ago
[00:51:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> a less than 2 years
[00:51:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> but around
[00:51:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and three years is almost a 6th of my life
[00:52:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> its weird how time and memories work like that
[00:52:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yeah
[00:52:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i don't think i remember loving him
[00:52:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> just hurting because of him
[00:52:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> but even that i forget sometimes
[00:52:51] [Server thread/INFO]: [tedzack: Set the weather to clear]
[00:53:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> so maybe all i remember about him is just
[00:53:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> the process of having been hurt
[00:53:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and maybe some continuing hurt
[00:53:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[00:54:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> thats no gud
[00:54:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but youre making progress paky
[00:54:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> youre gonna be okay
[00:54:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> tru
[00:54:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yay
[00:54:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i was telling andrew abt doing the creative project for ghosts
[00:55:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and he asked what it was abt
[00:55:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and i said that maybe it was a convo meant for a later time
[00:55:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and i think he realized smt was wrong
[00:55:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and he said that i didn't need to tell him
[00:55:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> :c
[00:55:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yeah
[00:58:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> are you okay pacy?
[00:59:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yeeeeeee
[00:59:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybe i should tell him
[00:59:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> so he can understand
[00:59:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> more abt
[00:59:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> why im' such a wreck lol
[00:59:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> it would at least explain my constant need to be reassured
[00:59:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that ppl care
[00:59:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i think its a good idea to tell him
[01:00:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and my fear of confrontation to some extent
[01:00:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybe i'll tell him
[01:00:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> at some pt during camp
