[00:00:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> they look so similar
[00:00:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> look at the wall
[00:00:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh
[00:00:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> left is block
[00:00:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybe smooth then
[00:00:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okey
[00:00:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> bc we don't wanna give off a greek tile look
[00:00:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[00:00:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> or roman tile look
[00:01:09] [Server thread/WARN]: Optix570 moved too quickly! -9.981039780982485,3.1921150873078687,1.3688276455956725
[00:01:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> which probably also means minimize pillar use
[00:01:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[00:01:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey build time
[00:02:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> where should entrance be
[00:02:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> uh idk
[00:02:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybe towards ocean
[00:02:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okey
[00:02:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> as in
[00:03:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> here
[00:03:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> or
[00:03:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> sure
[00:03:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> here
[00:03:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> mm
[00:03:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ocean might make more sense
[00:03:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that is a scary noise
[00:03:30] [Server thread/INFO]: [tedzack: Set the weather to clear]
[00:05:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> should it be odd or even
[00:05:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> even?
[00:05:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> uhhh
[00:05:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> sure ig
[00:06:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> ooooooo we could have pods
[00:06:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> where each section is a diff hexagon
[00:06:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and there are connections btwn the pods
[00:06:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[00:07:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and then each pod canbe a thing
[00:07:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> also its uneven
[00:07:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yee
[00:07:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> now good
[00:07:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> is that too big
[00:07:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> nah
[00:07:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> can make smaller
[00:07:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> so is it a dome
[00:07:37] [Server thread/INFO]: [tedzack: Set the time to 1000]
[00:07:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so that we have more room for other pods
[00:07:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okey
[00:07:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i think it should be fine
[00:07:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> if necessary we could also just make more room
[00:08:35] [Server thread/INFO]: [tedzack: Set the weather to clear]
[00:10:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> igloow
[00:10:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> lmao
[00:10:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yeet
[00:11:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> hmm
[00:11:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> should it be bulgy
[00:11:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> more
[00:11:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> like come out
[00:11:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> then dome?
[00:11:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> umm
[00:11:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk the dome just seems more like a pyramid?
[00:11:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh
[00:12:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> well its hard to make
[00:12:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> circles using cubes
[00:12:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> without it being really big
[00:12:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> hmm
[00:12:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> well it can be a hexagon
[00:12:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i looked it up and
[00:12:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> apparently domes need to be odd
[00:12:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh no
[00:12:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> do you want it to be a dome
[00:13:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i mean we could restart
[00:13:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> or start half
[00:13:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> imma send you the link in fb
[00:13:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[00:13:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that is a cool looking dome
[00:13:43] [Server thread/INFO]: [tedzack: Set the weather to clear]
[00:13:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yee
[00:13:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> buts its also very big
[00:14:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> thoughts on redoing it with odd and making it bigger
[00:14:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> they have different sizes
[00:14:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it might look better?
[00:14:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yea
[00:14:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay lets do it lol
[00:14:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> something else to think abt
[00:14:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybeb putting it ona platform
[00:14:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> so it doesn't seem so attached to the ground
[00:14:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> o
[00:15:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk i kinda like it on the ground
[00:15:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey that works
[00:15:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what size
[00:15:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> uhh

[00:15:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> think
[00:15:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> bigger might give us more flexibility
[00:15:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okey
[00:15:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> in what we do with the room
[00:15:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so 21
[00:15:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> we don't wanna feel limited in size
[00:15:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> once we do interior stuff
[00:15:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye

[01:14:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yeah that's fine

[01:14:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i just mean don't break another layer
[01:14:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and the top does it too
[01:14:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> no this is related to you breaking the ground

[01:27:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> is smt abt this off
[01:27:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wait

[01:28:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> these sides are too smol
[01:28:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it should be sevennn
[01:28:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but thats it
[01:28:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wait is it not right
[01:28:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh wait
[01:28:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> it looks off to me
[01:28:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> each side should be a 7x7 sq
[01:29:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> bc of the
[01:29:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> glowstone stuff
[01:29:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> is it not
[01:29:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> these sides are 6x7
[01:29:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> ohh
[01:29:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i mean do you wanna break one down
[01:29:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yeeeeeeeee
[01:29:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey let's do it
[01:29:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yayayay
[01:36:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> sorry had to go deal w a thing
[01:36:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> is okey
[01:37:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i figured we'd fill this area with water
[01:37:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> or at least parts of it
[01:38:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> the bottom?
[01:38:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> water dome
[01:38:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> o
[01:38:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[01:38:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> butt
[01:38:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> tis the main dome
[01:38:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so maybe not in here?
[01:38:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh
[01:38:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> um
[01:38:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what should this dome be then
[01:38:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk just
[01:38:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> reception desk + hallways?
[01:39:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> alternatively
[01:39:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> could be
[01:39:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> reception desk on top of glass?
[01:39:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> with water underneath
[01:39:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> ooooo
[01:39:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i like that a lot
[01:39:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey
[01:39:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[01:39:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> also entire area could be glass or could be just
[01:39:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> island
[01:39:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what do u think
[01:39:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> well
[01:39:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> idea
[01:40:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> water up to there
[01:40:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> smol bridge to a floating island
[01:40:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> o
[01:40:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> hmm
[01:40:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that has reception desk
[01:40:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> not water up to
[01:40:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ?
[01:40:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what
[01:40:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> why upt to there
[01:40:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> not water up to grass block?
[01:40:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[01:40:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so desk isnt floating in air lol
[01:41:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i mean we prob don't want it right next to door cause water too high?
[01:41:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> fair
[01:41:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> one down then?
[01:41:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> we could also surround the bottom of the desk with spiral staircase
[01:41:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that way not floating
[01:41:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and then
[01:41:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ok
[01:41:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idrk lol
[01:41:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> the staircase could lead into hallways underground
[01:41:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> we can change if we dont like
[01:41:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[01:41:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> how does that sound
[01:41:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okey
[01:41:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what color glass
[01:41:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> sounds fine
[01:41:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh
[01:42:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> clear?
[01:42:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yea prob
[01:42:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> we're classy
[01:42:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybe white
[01:42:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that usually works well methinks
[01:42:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> intuition says white or gray
[01:42:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> light gray
[01:42:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> light gray?
[01:42:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> or white
[01:42:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yee
[01:43:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[01:43:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey where did we do water until
[01:43:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i like light gray
[01:43:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> light gray seems nicer
[01:43:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yee
[01:43:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> uhh
[01:43:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> right under glass?
[01:43:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> that works
[01:44:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> flat water or water flowing inwards
[01:44:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> mmm
[01:44:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> intuition says flat
[01:44:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[01:44:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> might be wrong
[01:52:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that took way more effort than i thought it would tbh
[01:53:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> lol ye
[01:53:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> major igloor vibes
[01:53:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> igloor
[01:53:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> igloo!
[01:53:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> igoo
[01:53:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> let's make it more tropical
[01:53:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> heh
[01:53:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ok
[01:53:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> how
[01:53:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> well we could decorate it like a coral reef
[01:53:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> like the water
[01:53:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybe add vines
[01:54:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> lily pads
[01:54:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> leaves
[01:54:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> lmao
[01:54:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> nice
[01:55:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> ah nice
[01:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> keys could go in there
[01:56:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> or tickets perhaps
[01:56:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[01:56:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> look at these
[01:56:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> the sea pickles
[01:56:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wao
[01:56:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> can we do lamps instead of glowstone
[01:56:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> it doesn't look as nice
[01:56:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[01:57:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but
[01:57:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> lamps dont stick to the wall sideways
[01:57:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> they have to be above or below a block
[01:57:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> or did u mean redstone lanterns
[01:57:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> these are lamps
[01:57:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> the lanters are the thing ur talking abt
[01:57:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> where r u
[01:57:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> o
[01:57:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye but those need power
[01:57:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> alternatively
[01:58:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> that works
[02:00:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> also
[02:00:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> there is grass
[02:01:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> on the bottom
[02:01:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> lol
[02:01:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yea
[02:01:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> should it be sand?
[02:01:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> well its gonna be staircase anyway right
[02:01:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> o
[02:01:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ru
[02:01:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> tru
[02:02:02] [Server thread/INFO]: [Optix570: Set the time to 13000]
[02:02:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wao!
[02:03:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> oh how do we get to the staircase
[02:03:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> behind here?
[02:03:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> hmm
[02:04:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> alternatively it could be like a jump
[02:04:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> maybe it could start here
[02:04:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ?
[02:04:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and then spiral smaller
[02:04:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> sure
[02:04:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what should it be made of
[02:04:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> smooth quartz?
[02:04:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> quartz is good
[02:05:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what abt granite
[02:05:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> o
[02:05:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> perhaps
[02:05:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[02:05:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> up to u
[02:06:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> mm

[02:07:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> yea
[02:07:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ok
[02:08:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i was gonna do one big box around so it wouldn't look uneven from the outside
[02:08:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ok
[02:13:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> just use sponge
[02:14:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i feel like
[02:14:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> panes look odd
[02:14:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> cause

[02:14:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> well lets finish
[02:14:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and we can replace if want to
[02:14:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ok

[02:37:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> stairs end here
[02:37:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and then we can carve out an area
[02:37:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> maybe
[02:37:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and make multiple tunnels?
[02:37:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> hmm
[02:37:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[02:37:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> do you want
[02:37:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> another set of stairs
[02:38:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what do u think
[02:38:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> we can have one running opposit
[02:38:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> sure
[02:40:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wat
[02:40:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what
[02:40:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> im confused
[02:40:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what
[02:40:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it seems off
[02:40:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> it is
[02:41:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> its not the same legnth one way
[02:41:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i didn't think it'd be an issue since it wasn't frontfacing
[02:41:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> hmm
[02:42:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh no i fucked this up
[02:42:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> lol
[02:42:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what
[02:42:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> o
[02:43:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> no i just changed it
[02:43:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> to make them even
[02:43:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> now theyre good
[02:44:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> oof
[02:44:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> hmm
[02:44:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> one side is even
[02:44:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i will
[02:44:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> fix
[02:44:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what's up
[02:45:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh dear
[02:45:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i figured out how to fix the stair problem
[02:45:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> of turning
[02:45:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> but uh
[02:45:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> it requires we move all the stairs
[02:45:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> tis okey
[02:45:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> was gonna do that anyway lol
[02:45:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wait why do we need it even
[02:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> cause at the bottom each hallway should be 3x3
[02:46:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> leading to pods
[02:46:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> that are some odd number for fishies or w/e
[02:46:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> cause the whole sphere is built 7x7
[02:46:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey i'm a gonna do the ther stair then
[02:46:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ok
[02:48:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wait thheyre not even again
[02:49:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay shouldddd
[02:49:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> be even
[02:51:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wait what

[02:56:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye

[03:26:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wait lapis or black concrete
[03:26:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> for the walls of the tunnel
[03:26:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk

[03:37:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> this is a weird experience
[03:37:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> why dont they go on the sides
[03:37:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> unclear
[03:40:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what size should the next room be
[03:40:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i think
[03:40:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> 5x5
[03:42:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i'm sort of confused as to why they behave like that
[03:43:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> odd
[03:43:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> theyre lazyw
[03:43:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> you might be one space off
[03:43:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> where
[03:44:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> its two not three
[03:44:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> oh
[03:44:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> can fix
[03:47:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what's happening with the next room
[03:47:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> is it a dome
[03:47:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[03:47:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh i think what we could eventually do
[03:48:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> actuallynvm
[03:48:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey
[03:48:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> so dome
[03:48:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and then we connect to more dome from that dome
[03:48:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[03:48:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> ig w tunnels similar to these
[03:48:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> but with variation
[03:48:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> this dome is almost to ocean lol
[03:48:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so next dome would be
[03:48:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> in ocean
[03:49:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> well that's okey
[03:49:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okey
[03:49:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> cause then we can expand a bit into the ocean and finish that wing
