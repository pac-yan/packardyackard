[01:07:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> don't you think we're too young to fall in love
[01:07:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> is this a reference
[01:07:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> no i'm just making a statement
[01:07:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay
[01:07:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> then no
[01:08:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> fascinating
[01:09:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> why lol
[01:11:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> r u okey

[01:11:40] [Server thread/INFO]: [NSDATournament: Set own game mode to Survival Mode]
[01:11:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm fine
[01:12:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm just saying
[01:12:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> this is probably the wrong age to fall in love
[01:12:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> why
[01:13:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> our lives at this age are incredibly unpredictable within foreseeable future
[01:13:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or at least like
[01:13:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> any time soon
[01:13:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> any reasonable time
[01:14:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> unfortunately this is the best age to be in love
[01:14:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> failure of human development
[01:14:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i mean
[01:14:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ig
[01:15:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but also i think youre approaching this the wrong way
[01:15:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> in that by saying this is the wrong age to fall in love bc of unsure future you assume that it has to continue to the future
[01:15:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> well within reasonable future
[01:15:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and i think that love can just be enjoyed in the moment and doesnt necessarily have to be focused on long term relationships
[01:16:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like within time to develop meaningful relationships
[01:16:14] [Server thread/WARN]: Can't keep up! Is the server overloaded? Running 2615ms or 52 ticks behind
[01:16:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh
[01:16:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> also def of meaningfukl
[01:16:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> like
[01:16:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hmmmmm
[01:16:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> even if its short can still be meaningful
[01:16:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> maria and i talked abt this!
[01:16:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm not sure it meets my threshold for meaningful
[01:16:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> fair
[01:16:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think meaningful relationships require some deep understanding of another
[01:17:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and does that necessarily take a long time
[01:17:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> not a long time
[01:17:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but time
[01:17:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> more time than the unpredictability of our lives might allow for sufficiently
[01:17:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> fair
[01:17:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and that differs per relationship
[01:17:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[01:17:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like yes short moment stuff can be meaningful
[01:18:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like in a sense of meaning being a scalar
[01:18:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or that all events are meaningful
[01:18:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but the relationship is not meaningful, or doesn't cross a threshold for what one might call a meaningful relationship
[01:18:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like how we say relationships that last for onle a few days
[01:18:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> we might say those aren't real relationships
[01:18:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or question whether that really counts
[01:19:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> not bc we don't think individual events or conversations exchanged between the two were not meaningful
[01:19:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but bc we think the relationship hasn't crossed a certain threshold for what counts as a meaningful relationship, whatever that may be
[01:20:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i mean ig but i also feel like thats unecessary classification
[01:20:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> of like
[01:20:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> not meaningful
[01:20:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> esp because of outliers that def exist
[01:20:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think it points towards an area where humans haven't adapted yet
[01:20:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> a 'meaningful relationship' label is basically useless
[01:21:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> huh?
[01:21:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> its definitely relevant
[01:21:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i don't like unmeaningful relationships
[01:21:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and i think most people don't
[01:21:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> sure but its classification parameters are like
[01:21:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> completely subjective
[01:21:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and i certainly don't develop relationships with people just for meaningful events
[01:21:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm not sure that they are
[01:22:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> how
[01:22:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think that they are persuasively not well defined
[01:22:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> idk abt subjective
[01:22:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> well one can assert anything as anything but that doesn't mean they're right
[01:22:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hmmmmm
[01:22:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i feel like a persons personal feelings abt a relationship being meaningful or not automatically overrule any outside perspective
[01:22:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> lol
[01:22:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh
[01:23:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hmmm
[01:23:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why should it
[01:23:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> be cause its their relationship and its effect is on their life
[01:23:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh okey
[01:24:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so they would be a judge of its meaningfulness
[01:24:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> so anyone's opinion about a relationship they have - and how they relate to it - is true
[01:24:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or should be viewed as such
[01:24:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> is that the argument
[01:24:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i mean
[01:24:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> mostly but i agree there are def exceptions
[01:24:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like
[01:24:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and not all of their opinions abt their relationship are valid
[01:24:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and what makes them exceptional
[01:25:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why not
[01:25:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> like stockholm syndrome
[01:25:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why not
[01:25:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> what's the diff
[01:25:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> bc thats an inherently imbalanced relationship based on psychological abuse
[01:25:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and a person is not qualified to recognize that in their own life
[01:25:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i don't hold an actual opinion
[01:25:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because of its impact on their judgement
[01:25:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but i am fairly curious
[01:25:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm in one of my moods
[01:25:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh
[01:26:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[01:26:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> could that not easily be said for how meaningful people view relationships too?
[01:26:16] [Server thread/WARN]: Optix570 moved too quickly! 2.264639296391806,-0.03941189089844954,9.938337118478444
[01:26:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like if someone is like
[01:26:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i dated x person for 2 days
[01:26:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but it was the most meaningful relationship of my entire life
[01:26:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and say you know that they have like
[01:26:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> loving family
[01:26:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> good friends
[01:26:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> etc etc
[01:27:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> normal person, or at least one that isn't out of the ordinary
[01:27:14] [Server thread/WARN]: Fetching addPacket for removed entity
[01:27:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> you probably would be kinda skeptical
[01:27:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and believe that this is some form of delusion
[01:27:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> you could say that
[01:27:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and its fine to question it
[01:27:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> which seems to be the justification for why you would view someone with stockholm syndrome as being in a relationship that is negative even if they believe it to be positive
[01:28:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but in the end their mere act of believing that its the most meaningful makes it the most meaningful
[01:28:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but meaningful isnt inherently pos or neg
[01:28:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why does the mere act of believing that a relationship is positive not make it positive
[01:28:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> that is correct
[01:28:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so their judgement on meaningful shouldnt be questioned
[01:28:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but it is still a relationship one has towards a relationship
[01:28:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why not
[01:28:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but if theyre saying its the 'best' thats smth that can be argued
[01:28:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> we question people's judgement on pos and neg
[01:28:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but its the best to them
[01:29:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because its not pos or neg its the amt of impact
[01:29:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> what
[01:29:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> impact is easier to judge than pos and neg
[01:29:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm confused
[01:30:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> abt what
[01:30:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> your argument is that we can make judgements about whether a relationship is positive or negative than we can about whether relationships are meaningful or not because it is easier to judge whether a relationship is meaningful or not?
[01:30:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> kind of
[01:31:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> its that ppl are better suited to judge meaningfulness for themselves than they are to judge pos or neg
[01:31:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> wait i'm confused
[01:31:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and we should respect that
[01:31:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> previous example again
[01:31:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why can't we say
[01:31:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> nope this dude didn't have that meaningful of a relationship
[01:31:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like events meaningful, relationship no, he's deluding himself
[01:31:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because as soon as they think its meaningful it automatically is
[01:32:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but my question is why
[01:32:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like we don't accept it for stockholm syndrome
[01:32:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or abusive relationships
[01:32:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> we don't encourage them to stay even if tthey say they're happy or that its not abusive
[01:33:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> we usually discourage staying despite that
[01:33:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> people say
[01:33:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> they're happy in relationships when they're not
[01:33:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why don't we just accept that they're happy
[01:33:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think my arg is that they can be lying or deluding themselves the same way for whether a relationshpi is meaningful than they can with every aspect of the relationship
[01:33:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and we're perfectly okeyw ith making judgements about those parts
[01:34:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> especially if we feel like we have relevant information
[01:34:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but the only person who can completely understand the impact a relationship has on their life is that person
[01:34:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> you can argue with them and convince them that its not important
[01:34:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but as long as they believe it is important, it will be
[01:34:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> such as if someone were like oh my partner is so horrible to me, they don't even buy my dog birthday presents
[01:35:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> you would say
[01:35:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> wow that person's partner is not horrible to them, that person is just expecting too much
[01:35:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and is deluding themselves into thinking their partner is bad
[01:35:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why is that not true for everything
[01:35:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like yeah people can believe whatever
[01:36:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like someone can believe 3+2=10
[01:36:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but that doesn't mean they're right
[01:36:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why is meaning the exception to the general rule that we can probably make judgements - or that there can be some metric to make judgements - and people being wrong about their relationships?
[01:37:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because the whole thing abt abusive relationships is that people arent really happy but they think they are, but meaningfulness is completely based on a persons perception
[01:37:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> right but 3+2 is an accepted mathematical principle and immutable
[01:37:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but meaningfulness is inherently mutable based on the persons choice to value it or not
[01:37:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and if someone believes in say
[01:37:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> astrology
[01:38:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but they can also delude themselves about meaning the same way they can delude themselves about happiness
[01:38:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> theres no scientific basis for it but they will think that its really important
[01:38:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> sure
[01:38:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yes but that's ridiculous
[01:38:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> its pure fantasy
[01:38:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it is
[01:38:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> one would say its
[01:38:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> a delusion!
[01:38:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but relationships dont have a scientific basis
[01:38:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and that their meaning is baseless
[01:38:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i.e. meaningless
[01:38:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> you cant prove that this relationship had no meaning
[01:39:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and that this person is deluding themselves
[01:39:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> well i think clear examples prove that there is probably some basis for it
[01:39:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> also you say its mutable
[01:39:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but i think that assumes that its purely subjective
[01:40:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i feel like it is
[01:40:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> as soon as a person believes that a relationship is not meaningful it ceases to be
[01:40:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like this is also the argument that people use to argue for moral relativism
[01:40:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> that is it mutable just bc people can believe different things
[01:41:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but that assumes that there is no truth in the first place
[01:41:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> which is circular and not justified
[01:41:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay but this is different because this is a judgement that a person makes for themselves on something that happened to them
[01:41:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yeah so
[01:41:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i can say abusive relationships are bad
[01:41:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> even if the people in it want to stay in it
[01:41:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i can say a relationship is unhappy even when people in it insist that theya re happy
[01:42:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i can say a relationship is not working out even if the people in it insist that it is
[01:42:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why can't i say a relationship is not meaningful just because the individual(s) in it insist that it is
[01:43:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like yes it only happens to them
[01:43:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but then why do we care about abusive relationships that people want to stay in
[01:43:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like why do we get annoyed when people believe in conspiracy theories or astrology or falsified science
[01:43:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> if its jsut a question of personal belief
[01:44:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> we get angry at them because they try to project it onto other people when its obv falsified lmao but thats beside the point
[01:44:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> meaning is attributed by the individual
[01:44:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think i get angry at them even if they don't try and do that
[01:44:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or at least
[01:44:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i roll my eyes at them
[01:44:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> metaphorically speaking
[01:45:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like come on
[01:45:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and you can try to convince someone that a relationship is not meaningful but as long as they believe it is, it is to them
[01:45:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yeah because those people are stupid lmao
[01:45:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> people being stupid annoys everyone
[01:45:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yes!
[01:45:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> bc we think they're wrong!
[01:45:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or expressing incompetence!
[01:45:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but theyre also empirically wrong
[01:45:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or delusion!
[01:45:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> sometimes its not their fault
[01:45:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yes but that once again assumes that its not an empirical thing
[01:45:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think we can say some relationships are abusive
[01:45:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> even if there's no brightline
[01:46:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hmmmm
[01:46:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> meaning
[01:47:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[01:47:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think meaning is about importance or significance
[01:47:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> ooooo wait
[01:47:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> maybe the way we can solve this
[01:47:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i think that meaning is diff from being happy or emotionally manipulated
[01:47:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yes but there seems to be no difference in form
[01:47:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like all are just one's own view of an aspect of a relationship
[01:47:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> there is in that happiness is not like
[01:48:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> attributed i guess?
[01:48:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm happy in this relationship
[01:48:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm unhappy in this relationship
[01:48:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> this relationship is meaningful
[01:48:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> the whole thing with abusive relationships is that theyre deluding themselves into thinking theyre happy when theyre not
[01:48:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> this relationship is not meaningful
[01:48:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yessir
[01:48:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but
[01:48:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and you can delude yourlsef into thinking somethin gis meaningful?
[01:48:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> people do it all the time
[01:48:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> we can argue abt actual effects
[01:48:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> they tie their own self worth to things that one might say shouldn't or don't define one's self worth
[01:49:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> like stars dont affect your life
[01:49:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> such as
[01:49:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but if someone reads their horoscope and believes that its meaningful they will try to apply it to their life
[01:49:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yes!
[01:49:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and in that sense it is meaningful
[01:49:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and they're wrong!
[01:49:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but the wrong meaningful
[01:49:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> theyre wrong that stars affect their life
[01:50:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> right
[01:50:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but their belief that the stars affect their life changes their life in a certain way
[01:50:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and in that way it is meaningful
[01:50:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> so they're tying meaning to something meaningless
[01:50:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> is that the conclusion
[01:50:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but because they give it meaning, it then has an effect
[01:50:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> changing life in a certain way doesn't mean its meaningful
[01:51:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> really?
[01:51:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> meaningful is definitely more than any effect
[01:51:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> it has to be something significant
[01:51:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> see but significant is subjective
[01:51:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so we fall back on
[01:51:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like me wacking myself on a pipe at andrew's dermatologist certainly had an effect on my life but i would not say it was a significant one
[01:51:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> a person self attributes meaning and therefore chooses which events are meaningful
[01:52:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> right YOU would not say its significant
[01:52:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what if i said it was
[01:52:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and you were deluding yourself
[01:52:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i dont have any basis for that
[01:52:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> well you'd be wrong
[01:52:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but there is a basis for it
[01:52:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> you can say whatever you want and i can say whatever i want
[01:52:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> that doesn't make either of us right
[01:52:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i don't think we would want to accept a world where meaning is subjective though
[01:53:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like meaningful is definitely not like
[01:53:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> has ANY effect
[01:53:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> it has to have a significant effect
[01:53:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i think a world where meaning is subjective to oneself is fine
[01:53:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and if significant is subjective
[01:53:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> then the word means nothing
[01:53:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> just like how doing the right thing - if subjective - means nothing either
[01:53:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> pakyyy
[01:53:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and if we accept that it means something
[01:53:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> no morals
[01:54:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> >:c
[01:54:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> then we have to accept that there's some threshold for what counts and what doesn't
[01:54:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> morals is just the analogy
[01:54:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> fine
[01:54:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but you cant say there is a threshold
[01:54:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because diff things are significant/meaningful to diff ppl
[01:54:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> ofc
[01:55:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and some things aren't truly meaningful
[01:55:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> for example
[01:55:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> the clothes people choose to wear
[01:55:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> probably not truly meaningful
[01:55:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> see then you run into trouble again
[01:55:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> if the clothes they wear get them bullied and leads to a decrease in self esteem, then the clothes they wear are meaningful
[01:55:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> bc people can think the kinds of clothes they wear are meaningful?
[01:55:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yeah and they can be wrong
[01:56:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yes but
[01:56:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> we would say that the bullies are wrong
[01:56:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> the conclusion shouldn't be - the bullies are right my clothes are meaningful, even if that's the smarter conclusion to reach
[01:56:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> the conclusion should be - nope they're wrong, my clothes shouldn't define my self worth
[01:56:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like if my mom were like you're a terrible person bc you're not skinny enough
[01:56:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i shouldn't be like
[01:56:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> u right
[01:57:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but i am skinny enough so i'm not a terrible person
[01:57:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what if it was like
[01:57:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> it should be
[01:57:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> a child died in a war in the middle east
[01:57:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm not defined by my weight
[01:57:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and someone says that they cried all night because they saw pictures and they had nightmares
[01:57:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and someone else says they werent bothered at all
[01:57:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> is that childs death meaningful?
[01:57:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it depends on the person
[01:57:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> that child's death is meaningful independent of either of their reactions
[01:58:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> what.
[01:58:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> well
[01:58:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> meaningful to them is diff than
[01:58:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> meaningful in general
[01:58:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or meaningful as a value judgement
[01:58:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it depends on the individual whether that childs death was meaningful to them
[01:58:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> sure it was meaningful in a vacuum
[01:58:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> uhhh yeah
[01:58:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but they'd be wrong to say that the child's death wasn't meaningful just bc they themselves don't care
[01:58:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> sure
[01:58:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and i would hazard to say that the perosn who wasn't bothered should be bothered
[01:59:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but relationships inherently have to do with the person experiencing them
[01:59:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> so do beliefs people hold that are wrong
[01:59:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like astrology
[01:59:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or like
[01:59:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> clothes
[02:00:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> being connected to self worth
[02:00:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> right but you cant say that something was meaningful to someone when it wasnt
[02:00:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or at least defined by others
[02:00:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yeah you can
[02:00:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> let's say
[02:00:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and regardless of how meaningful that childs death is in a vacuum it doesnt change the fact that it wasnt meaningful to this one person
[02:01:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yeah but that just means that person is wrong if they belive the child's death wasn't meaningful
[02:01:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> not that that person is right its not meaningful or that they can decide whether its meaningful
[02:01:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> bc its meaningful independent of them
[02:01:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> that person is still right in that its not meaningful to them
[02:01:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> uhhh sure but that's not the meaningful that i care about
[02:02:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and not the only meaningful that exists
[02:02:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like if i said
[02:02:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> are you trying to judge the meaningfulness of a relationship in a vacuum/
[02:02:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ?
[02:02:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i feel like individual meaningfulness is the most important kind of meaningfulness in a relationship
[02:02:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hey elijah! i decided i was actually really happy with max and want to get back together with him
[02:02:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> you'd be like
[02:02:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> no you were not happy
[02:03:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> not oh you think you were happy - therefore that's what matters
[02:03:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> same thing applies
[02:03:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> just bc i think its meaningful doesn't mean it is
[02:03:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but just because you think youre happy doesnt make you happy
[02:03:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> its different with meaning
[02:03:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think i would argue that individual meaninfulness should follow what is truly anda ctually meaningful
[02:03:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay
[02:03:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> just bc you think its meaningful doesn't mean it is
[02:03:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but again
[02:03:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> a death is bright line meaningful
[02:03:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because human death sure
[02:04:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but its such a gray area with relationships
[02:04:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> just bc someone thinks that their self worth is tied meaningfully to
[02:04:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> idk
[02:04:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> the type of car they drive
[02:04:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> doesn't mean it is
[02:04:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or should be
[02:04:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> should is a diff question
[02:04:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> really? there's no brightline for an abusive relationships but we won't hesitate to think that's unhealthy when we see one
[02:04:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> there's no brightline for what is a true manifestation of someone's bad character but we're willing to be like thaat person's a jerk
[02:05:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> sure
[02:05:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> just bc someone who was in a relationship for a few days thinks it was really meaningful
[02:05:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> doesn't mean that it truly was
[02:05:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but can you immediately look at a relationship and tell whether it was meaningful or not
[02:05:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or at least meaningful in the way that relationships should be
[02:05:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> prescriptive again
[02:05:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> uhh sometimes i think
[02:05:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> in what way should relationships be meaningful
[02:06:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but obvi should know some relevant features
[02:06:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> so this is more philosophical than i intended this to go
[02:06:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> lol
[02:06:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but like meaning has to do with like
[02:06:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> what the concept behind a thing is
[02:06:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or let's say
[02:06:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> what the form of that thing is
[02:06:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> which we often interpret to be the best version of that thing
[02:07:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> meaningful, then, has to do with something having significant meaning
[02:07:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> in other words
[02:07:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> demonstrating the best version of that thing
[02:07:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or rather
[02:08:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> better or worse version of that thing
[02:08:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> there is also meaningful in a bad way
[02:08:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but you cant rank relationships on a scale from best to worst
[02:08:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> so it depends on what we mean by meaningful
[02:08:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because theyre all different
[02:09:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and there isnt really an ideal form of a relationship
[02:09:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> other than treating someone with dignity and respect
[02:09:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> most of us say meaningful relationship, we mean relationships that have imapcted us in a good way, there are also meaningfully bad relationships, usually demonstrating something that represents a bad relationships
[02:09:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hmmmmmmm
[02:09:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> you can't
[02:10:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> just like how you can't rank chairs on a scale from best the worst
[02:10:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but that doesn't deny that there exists better and worse chairs
[02:10:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> nor that there isa form of a chair
[02:10:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i feel like the form of a chair is just something that will support you in a seated position
[02:10:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and so
[02:11:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> there may be better or worse chairs
[02:11:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but how good that chair (i.e. its meaningfulness) is dependent on the person using it
[02:11:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> therefore its inherently subjective
[02:12:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because its what works for them or what doesnt
[02:12:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> meaningful relationships implies maybe a judgement of how good of a relationship it is - how much of the concept of a relationship it has
[02:12:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> its not inherently subjective its just subjective bc there's a circumstance
[02:12:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and certain amounts of subjectivity
[02:12:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> doesn't make it inherently subjective
[02:13:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like for example: we're willing to say people who murder in cold blood are bad
[02:13:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but how can it exist without circumstance
[02:13:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but then there are other moral bads that we are willing to be hesitant on
[02:13:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like
[02:13:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> stealing
[02:13:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> lying
[02:13:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> etc
[02:13:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> the only way to make a value judgement on a chair is to examine its usefulness in a circumstance
[02:14:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> bc we sometimes think maybe that is acceptable
[02:14:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or we can see why it would be
[02:14:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> which probably introduces a certain amoutn of subjectivity
[02:14:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or maybe
[02:14:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> we think ppl who murder are bad
[02:14:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but we don't think ppl who think the color blue is ugly are bad
[02:15:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> bc yes some things can be subjective
[02:15:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> doesn't mean all things are
[02:15:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay
[02:15:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but besides the point again
[02:15:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> not at all besides the point
[02:15:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i feel like relationships are significantly subjective
[02:15:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> value judgements of a chair
[02:15:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> can be subjective sometimes
[02:15:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> doesn't mean they entirely are
[02:15:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> when is it not subjective
[02:15:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> value judgement of relationships can be subjective doesn tmean they are
[02:15:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> well that depends on the form of a chair
[02:16:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> the form of a relationship
[02:16:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> do you disagree with my form
[02:16:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and what the ultimate ideal of either look like
[02:16:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> right
[02:16:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> that its just something to sit on?
[02:16:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so
[02:16:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> do you have a form of a relationship
[02:16:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think a wooden chair might be a better chair than a like a toppled tree
[02:16:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oooooooooo
[02:17:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> now that's the best question
[02:17:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> bc there is certainly a form
[02:17:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but all a form does is qualify what is and isn't a relationship
[02:17:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> if the ground is muddy and the tree is stable then the tree might be a better chair
[02:17:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> is there a form for a meaningful relationship
[02:17:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[02:17:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[02:18:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> insofar as you cant really define it
[02:18:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> doesn't mean it doesn't exist
[02:18:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> true
[02:18:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> this one requires more noggin
[02:18:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> wait no
[02:18:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but it does mean that there is more subjectivity
[02:18:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so
[02:18:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> ground stable doesn't persuade me that trunk is better chair
[02:19:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> bc chairness is probably not defined merely by usefulness imo
[02:19:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> just like how better friendship is not defined by usefulness
[02:19:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but a friend is not a chair
[02:19:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> wait no it doesn't
[02:19:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> a chair exists to be sat on
[02:19:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> that is literally its only purpose
[02:19:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> a friend is much more complex
[02:19:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> and chairness - like friendshipness - doesn't require usefulness to define it
[02:19:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so yes chairness is definitely defined by usefulness
[02:19:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> what
[02:19:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> existing to be sat on doesn't mean usefulness
[02:20:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay
[02:20:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but we define a 'good' and 'bad' chair by its usefulness
[02:20:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> a 'bad' chair is one that cannot be sat on and is not useful
[02:20:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh no
[02:20:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> a good chair is the opposite
[02:20:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> when i say better chair
[02:20:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i mean
[02:20:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> not like
[02:20:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> good bad
[02:20:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i mean
[02:20:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> the more chair chair
[02:20:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> sure
[02:21:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> which might be kinda distinct from good or bad
[02:21:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and wouldnt the more chair chair be more useful as a chair
[02:21:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but GOOD chair
[02:21:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> would it be?
[02:21:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> interesting
[02:21:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i feel like it would have to be
[02:21:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i dont see how it would be separate from that lmao
[02:21:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> what's a good or bad friendship
[02:21:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> :(
[02:21:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> if not defined by usefulness?
[02:21:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> the more friend friend
[02:22:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i think usefulness is a cold way of putting it
[02:22:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> haha
[02:22:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> lmao
[02:22:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yeah well
[02:22:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> that's a cold way of treating the chair
[02:22:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> chairs dont have feelings
[02:22:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wait
[02:22:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> fuck dont argue that
[02:22:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> also you have the server up right
[02:22:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yes
[02:22:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> can you copy this convo to me i think i need to think abt it more tomorrow
[02:23:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ummm
[02:23:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk if i can do that
[02:23:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> actually wait i might be able to
[02:23:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why not
[02:23:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> it should be on the jar file
[02:23:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or whatever
[02:23:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> right
[02:25:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay i got it
[02:25:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i had to copy from the sever output
[02:25:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hahahaha

[02:27:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> thanks friend
[02:27:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> np
[02:27:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yee
[02:28:08] [Server thread/WARN]: Can't keep up! Is the server overloaded? Running 2019ms or 40 ticks behind
[02:28:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but that our differences are probably reconciled by preciseness
[02:28:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> common problem in philosophy
[02:28:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> we are probably disagreeing about different things
[02:28:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> common problem in life probably
[02:28:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yeet
[02:28:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> lol
[02:28:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yessssssssssssir
[02:28:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wow its been a while since we had a discussion like this
[02:29:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> feels good
[02:29:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh have we had the incest convo yet
[02:29:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> aw fuck
[02:29:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> where i think its intrinsically permissable
[02:29:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> no
[02:29:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i think we might've
[02:29:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> nononono not tonight
[02:29:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i had that in my english calss
[02:29:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i've convinced most people i know that its totally fine
[02:29:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> like the act itself
[02:29:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ,,,
[02:30:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> weird flex but okay
[02:30:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> one of few exceptions is someone who is very christian
[02:30:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> you are tricky
[02:30:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i am not at all persuaded
[02:30:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> that incest is intrinsically bad
[02:30:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> here i'll lay out the common args for you
[02:31:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> nonoNOOOOONONON
[02:31:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> dont
[02:31:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> >:c
[02:31:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ik what they are
[02:31:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> - children might have genetic problems - ew gross
[02:32:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> pacy there will be NO TALK of incest on my GOOD CHRISTIAN MINECRAFT SERVER
[02:32:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> the first one isn't intrinsic to the act, infertility, birth control, etc. solve and the numbers are overblown anyway
[02:32:19] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] this is god and i disapprove of this talk of incest
[02:33:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> second one isn't intrinsic either - it just our intuition based on cultural influence, but we should demolish that of which are unfounded in real basis
[02:33:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh
[02:33:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> hi god
[02:33:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> pacyyy

[02:33:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i mean yeah
[02:33:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> ew gross incest
[02:34:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but permissable!
[02:34:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay okay youre right
[02:34:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> are we done with this convooo
[02:34:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> LOL
[02:34:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> ur mean
[02:34:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> fine what convo do you want to have
[02:34:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> no im nott
[02:34:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i just dont wanna talk abt incest
[02:34:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[02:35:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh
[02:35:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> okey dokey
[02:35:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i wish minecraft chat had stickers
[02:35:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i would send uncomfy bun
[02:35:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> minecraft chat is ugly
[02:35:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> yep
[02:36:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> anywas
[02:36:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> we're at a young age to fall in love bc in the past this was the age ppl get married and such
[02:36:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> oh do you want to talk abt malthus
[02:36:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ,,,
[02:36:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> nooooo
[02:36:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but nowadays we don't get married at this age as much
[02:37:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm not a utilitarian so i don' tbelive this but this is probably a sociological theory that is true
[02:37:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> in a sociological sense
[02:37:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> that we have too many people?
[02:37:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but love is meaningful on its own independent of its evolutionary benefit
[02:37:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> :C
[02:37:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> malthusss
[02:37:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> solves the problem
[02:37:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> many humans
[02:37:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> did i tell u abt my ra
[02:38:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> who put up a malthus did nothing wrong sign
[02:38:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> wait no
[02:38:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> thanos did nothing wrong
[02:38:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and then posted a population graph
[02:38:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i was actually low key kind of upset lmao\
[02:39:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> why were you upset
[02:39:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i'm inclined to believe that antinatalism might be true
[02:39:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because my school is literally an ir school
[02:39:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> or at least consider the arg
[02:39:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> but not for the reason malthus proposes probably
[02:39:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and one of the first things you learn in ir101 is that all evidence points to increasing standard of living decreases birth rates
[02:40:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yessir
[02:40:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> therefore
[02:40:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> malthusian crisis is inherently self solving without the need for mass extermination
[02:40:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> birth isn't consensual
[02:40:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> which is what the ra's board was implying
[02:40:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okay i'm not gonna touch that either
[02:40:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yes and no
[02:40:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yes in the sense that overpopulation from constant birth is not the issue
[02:41:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> no as in overpopulation can still happen independent of that
[02:41:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> mmm
[02:41:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i would tend to disagree
[02:41:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> such as migration, elderly, living space, etc.
[02:41:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> because in very 'developed' nations birth rates fall below replacement
[02:42:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> see japan and finland
[02:42:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and sweden i think
[02:42:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> oh yeah idt malthus is right
[02:42:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> i just think overpopulation is not just birthrate
[02:42:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> thats fair
[02:42:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> youre right
[02:42:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> yessir
[02:42:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> malthus!
[02:42:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> eliminate everyone
[02:43:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> malthus squared
[02:43:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <NSDATournament> that's not malthus squared
