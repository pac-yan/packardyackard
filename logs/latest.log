[00:24:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> idk
[00:24:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> rather than a perfect circle
[00:24:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> so that its like a thing you walk around?
[00:24:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> we could section off part of the ocean
[00:24:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> but a large part so its not as noticeable
[00:25:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and have animals n stuff
[00:25:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> but that's work
[00:25:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i have no creativity left for today
[00:25:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> just tell me what to build
[00:25:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey
[00:25:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> uhhh

[00:26:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> uh
[00:26:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybe andesite
[00:26:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> the glass should beee

[00:26:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ok
[00:31:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> is this okay

[00:36:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> what glass
[00:36:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i thought the floor was stone
[00:36:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i meant for the walsl
[00:36:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> like what are you using
[00:36:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> cyan
[00:39:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh this is a thinner tunnel that i anticipated
[00:39:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> what
[00:39:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it's 3x3
[00:39:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> how wide do u want it
[00:39:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> it feels tighter
[00:39:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> hmmmmm
[00:39:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> not sure
[00:39:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> 5x5?
[00:39:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> uhh
[00:39:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> i can work on expanding it
[00:39:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okey
[00:42:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> your tunnel is too wide
[00:42:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> thats 7x7
[00:42:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> does it look weird
[00:42:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> no its just
[00:42:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> too big?
[00:43:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wha
[00:43:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> how
[00:43:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> this glass is big enough for a 7x7 tunnel
[00:43:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> and its also not symmetrical
[00:44:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oops
[00:44:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i mean we can do this
[00:44:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> but it will look different from inside
[00:44:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wait it is
[00:44:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh
[00:44:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wait does it look bad?
[00:45:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> maybe a rectangular tunnel?
[00:45:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it doesnt have to be rectangular, it can have cut corners
[00:45:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wait so
[00:45:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> tcontiue this
[00:45:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> or does it look bad
[00:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it will look different from inside
[00:46:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> so just
[00:46:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> wdym by that
[00:46:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> follow the brick outline that i gave you
[00:46:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> it wont be square
[00:46:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> all the tunnels inside are square
[00:46:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey
[00:46:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> so i just follow that
[00:46:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> ?
[00:46:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> ye
[00:48:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh this needs to be expanded more

[01:06:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> this is prob not a place place to stop
[01:06:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> its like a wide
[01:06:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> reefy area
[01:06:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> folks can go for a swim
[01:06:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> alternatively we can just keep going
[01:06:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> oh we can also make it lead
[01:06:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> to a home
[01:06:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> like the compound
[01:06:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> i meannn

[01:07:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> sads
[01:07:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> we could make the tunnel go two ways
[01:07:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> one to swims
[01:08:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> and then the other to home
[01:08:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Optix570> okey
[01:08:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> okey
[01:08:38] [Server thread/INFO]: [tedzack: Set the time to 1000]
[01:08:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> that would be long tho
[01:09:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <tedzack> alternatively just have it open up here
